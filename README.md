# Round 2 Most of Content is on the Page , going to work my way down and adjust what is needed
# Next Step is to adjust the nav bar menu and make it look good. 

# Need to a create an element to contain all the header elements including the menu bar header text and hero image 
# Need to give this element a grey background 
# Need some text to be white and it looks like bolded as well as blue button with rounded corners
# Hero Text, subtext and button need to be in a column parallel to the Hero image
# looks like equal padding on either side, so two columns of content 
# the subtext is lower contrast and is smaller font but lets start from the top.
